next:

  - re-add dense indentation mode
  - add a type for spacing inside/outside containers, around delimiters and etc
  - start adding funky types, like bigint, bytearray, etc
  - special colors for globals like math
  - special colors for global first level members if it's not a hassle
    - like number.PositiveInfinity
  - special colors for special numbers like NaN
  - special colors for template strings
  - special colors for workers
  - special colors for DOM elements
  - special colors for common vended objects, like Date, RegExp, Error, Promise, reflection stuff, Atomics
  - voluntarily add characters at the edge of indentation, like npm tree
    - will need to be able to easy-mode the box corners if so
  - voluntary add prefix strings, like '. ', to show indent like a ToC
  - wrap if over a length
    - wrap if doesn't fit current screen width, may be the same as above
  - elide after N entries
  - elide after N depth
  - make a version that works in the developer console
  - make a cli that eats files or takes quoted strings 
  - argument to sort by key
  - js console friendly output
  - npm publish
  - add npm link to base_README
  - add magic code donator via gh link shenanigans
  - add decoder for theme-in-envvar
  - optional preset headers, so it writes `Map {<` instead of just `{<`
    - the type name needs its own color
    - objects and symbols should extend this with the name and 
      description respectively
  - alter the github action to make a release
  - alter the github action to make an npm publish
  - background color
  - fix the palettes.  
    - they need to be heirarchalized
    - many aren't included at all since being pulled into subfiles
    - there needs to be an "all list" that subsumes all the other lists
    - the viewer html app needs to be switched to the all list
    - the html app may need a pseudo-heirarchalized list 
      - this needs to be a dynamic tree, or the color and vision palettes will overwhelm
  - add the todo scanner
  - add the changelog generator
  - the defaults are set up for a logger (one line, no eliding, no typenames, etc,) but you
    want really different stuff for development, browsing, etc.  make default configs so you
    can write something like k.ansi_from_value(val, k.developer)
  - investigate images as an output type, for the screenshot crowd (which includes me.)
    - downside: node has no built in image library, and jimp is huge
  - show special characters (\r\n\t\v) as special characters instead
    - are they highlit?  oh yes they are.
  - display whitespace (word processor style)
  - make a function that creates a palette from key input colors and math, for more consistent palettes

  - build script to draw screenshots of the themes and add them to the readme

  - dependencies?
    - consider removing chalk in favor of a homebrew color solution
    - consider removing commander in favor of a homebrew cli solution
    - both of those gone, we could call ourselves zero dep

  - put skip headings in the video so people can skip over the boring parts
  - sanitize the video of personal information.  
    - do not pull a DoD and leave rectangles you can look under
