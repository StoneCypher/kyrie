    - like number.PositiveInfinity
  - special colors for special numbers like NaN
  - special colors for template strings
  - special colors for workers
  - voluntarily add characters at the edge of indentation, like npm tree
    - will need to be able to easy-mode the box corners if so

  - npm publish
  - add npm link to base_README
  - add configurator link to base_README
  - add magic code donator via gh link shenanigans
  - add decoder for theme-in-envvar
  - optional preset headers, so it writes `Map {<` instead of just `{<`

    - objects and symbols should extend this with the name and 
      description respectively
  - alter the github action to make a release
  - alter the github action to make an npm publish
  - drop a js file during build with 
    - package version, 
    - build date/time,

  - fix the palettes.  
    - they need to be heirarchalized
    - many aren't included at all since being pulled into subfiles
    - there needs to be an "all list" that subsumes all the other lists
    - the viewer html app needs to be switched to the all list
    - the html app may need a pseudo-heirarchalized list 
      - this needs to be a dynamic tree, or the color and vision palettes will overwhelm
  - add the todo scanner
  - add the changelog generator

  - build script to draw screenshots of the themes and add them to the readme

  - dependencies?
    - consider removing chalk in favor of a homebrew color solution
    - consider removing commander in favor of a homebrew cli solution
    - both of those gone, we could call ourselves zero dep

  - put skip headings in the video so people can skip over the boring parts
