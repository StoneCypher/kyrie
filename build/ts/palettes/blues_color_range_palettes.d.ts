/**
 * Blues color range palette collection
 *
 * This file contains color palettes that combine blues (60-70%) with other colors (30-40%).
 * Each palette includes both light and dark variants for different background themes.
 * Blues dominates to maintain a consistent blue-themed aesthetic while adding accent colors.
