/**
 * Cyans Color Range Palette Collection
 *
 * This module contains color palettes that heavily emphasize cyan colors (60-70%)
 * while incorporating complementary colors (30-40%) for variety and visual interest.
 *
 * Each palette includes both light and dark variants:
 * - Light variants use darker colors suitable for light backgrounds
 * - Dark variants use lighter colors suitable for dark backgrounds
 *
 * Available palettes:
 * - cyansAndReds: Cyan-dominant with red accents
 * - cyansAndOranges: Cyan-dominant with orange accents
 * - cyansAndYellows: Cyan-dominant with yellow accents
 * - cyansAndGreens: Cyan-dominant with green accents
 * - cyansAndBlues: Cyan-dominant with blue accents
 * - cyansAndPurples: Cyan-dominant with purple accents
 * - cyansAndBrowns: Cyan-dominant with brown accents
 * - cyansAndGreys: Cyan-dominant with grey accents
 * - cyansAndCharcoals: Cyan-dominant with charcoal accents
 * - cyansAndMagentas: Cyan-dominant with magenta accents
 * - cyansAndLightGrays: Cyan-dominant with light gray accents
