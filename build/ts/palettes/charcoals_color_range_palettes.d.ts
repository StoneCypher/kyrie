/**
 * Charcoals Color Range Palettes Collection
 *
 * This file contains a collection of color palettes that combine charcoal tones (grays and dark neutrals)
 * with various color ranges. Each palette emphasizes charcoals (60-70%) over the secondary color (30-40%),
 * creating sophisticated, muted color schemes suitable for syntax highlighting.
 *
 * Each palette includes both light and dark variants:
 * - Light variant: Uses darker colors for visibility on light backgrounds
 * - Dark variant: Uses lighter colors for visibility on dark backgrounds
